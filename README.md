# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) program. It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various deep learning topics. In most cases, the notebooks lead you through implementing models such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and GANs. There are other general topics covered such as cloud computing and hyperparameter tuning.

Here are links to my projects: 

## [Project 1: Neural Network from Scratch](https://github.com/momonala/udacity_deeplearning_ND/blob/master/first-neural-network/Your_first_neural_network.ipynb)

Built my own feedforward +back propogation + gradient descent neural network from scratch in numpy that works on the bike sharing dataset. 

## [Project 2: Cifar Image Classificaiton with a convnet](https://github.com/momonala/udacity_deeplearning_ND/blob/master/image-classification/dlnd_image_classification.ipynb)


Built my own convnet in tensorflow to classify 10 images in the cifar dataset. Ran and tested on a Floyd cloud GPU. 

## [Project 3: Recurrent Neural Net for TV Script generation](https://github.com/momonala/udacity_deeplearning_ND/blob/master/tv-script-generation/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb)


Using an LSTM RNN to generate a Simpson's script - data from IMBD. 

## [Project 4: Machine Translation - French to English](https://github.com/momonala/udacity_deeplearning_ND/blob/master/language-translation/dlnd_language_translation.ipynb)
 
Built a sequence-to-sequence Encoder/Decoder RNN to translate english to french. 

## [Project 5: Face Generation with GANs](https://github.com/momonala/udacity_deeplearning_ND/blob/master/face_generation/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb)

Built a Generative Adverserial Network which generates faces trained from a celebrity image dataset.
